## Welcome to the MB art website!




















## This is my website that is dedicated to art, but not just any art. MY art!

This site was created so that I could store pictures of my art, take commission request and even upload music.

## What is the site's components?

I'm going to be straightfoward here, the site was created with the big three of web dev: HTML, CSS and Javascript (note: java and javascript are NOT the same thing. It happens a lot but still, NOT the same thing). I also used a bit of SCSS (aka Sass CSS) and the piece de resistance: Angular.

## Why dark theme?

Light theme scares me, it's so bright and just looking at a bright screen for hours is just torture. That's why my site is dark theme and it is high contrast. Even better.

## That's all Fleet!!
