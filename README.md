## Welcome to the MB art website!

This is a website that was created solely for art... Introducing the MB art website. Dive into more details below...


















## This is my website that is dedicated to art, but not just any art. MY art!

This site was created so that I could store pictures of my art, take commission request and even upload music.

## Some useful knowledge about my website:

### Site components.

I'm going to be straightfoward here, the site was created with the big three of web dev: HTML, CSS and Javascript (note: java and javascript are NOT the same thing). I also used a bit of SCSS (aka Sass CSS) and the piece de resistance: Angular.
### More on Angular:

Angular is a web application framework that works with Javascript and Typescript. Typescript isn't accepted by browsers and Javascript is so there is a conversion process taking place (however I don't know much about that yet). Typescript is just Javascript with a few changes and the two work hand-in-hand to help Angular do its job. You can visit the website at: http://angular.io/

### More on SCSS:

I didn't use CSS, I used Sass CSS, a version of CSS with a few differences. The website link is right here if you want more information on it:https://sass-lang.com/

### Now something important: Dark theme(?)

Light theme scares me, it's so bright and just looking at a bright screen for hours is just torture. That's why my site is dark theme and it is high contrast. Even better. >:). I am sorry if Dark theme annoy you but adjusting the theme is one way of using CSS, try that the next time you make a website.

## That's all folks!!

Lol. Have a nice day.
